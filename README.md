# Sentiment-Analysis
Dear Sir/Mam,

Thank you for giving me this oppurtunity for doing Data-Science Project.

Here i am explaning how i divided my solution and reached to particular solution.

Step 1:

1) Firstly i go through the objective file and analysed what to do as well what is asked for . I also started dividing the steps when and how i can achieve this task.
2) After opening the input file half the data extraction file was easy to understand but still was not aware what to do next.
3) Finally opening the output file i came to know , ok this is the project now i can start the execution.

Step 2:(Code Mode)

1) So using library pandas and i knew how to read a file but i never extracted text from urls.
2) I started leaning on youtube and scrolling net after that i was confident that i can use the Beautifulsoup , requests library for data extraction.
3) Now main task was yet to start as it was nlp but the main problem was its not even started where i am doing course of data science and artifical intelligence.
4) Now i cant seek help from my mentor as the files are confidential and nlp will going to happen for upcoming classes.

Step 3: (Analysis Part)
1) I completely devoted one day to study NLP but still cant figure out how to get the analyis part.
2) On Day three i remembered there was output file excel sheet where i can see what to do , then icame to know about positive words.
3) For that i found that sentimental analysis is being used so i did all the steps.

Step 4:(Shortening the code)
1) Now i just want to shorten the code so by using minimum of code with correct execution i will achieve the output.



=> HOW TO RUN PY FILE:

You can run it in Jupyter Notebook or any latest version of idle. Also you also need to install some libraries(textblob) before running the program.  


Thank You
